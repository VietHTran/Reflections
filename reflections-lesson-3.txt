When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to work with other people on different computers and save the project files in case the computer is damaged or lost.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's more memory and power efficient to choose what you want to update especially when working on big projects.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Copies of repositories on GitHub server. Used when editing the repository without the owner permission.
    Clones: Copies of repositories on local storage. Used when working with the repository on the local computer.
    Branches: A string of commits connected to one another. Used when to experiment something.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Solve merge conflict easier without using Internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using Git or GitHub would be easier as it let your collaborators see your changes and can approve or disapprove of
    your changes without messing the project repository much.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you're not sure whether the changes are good or your collaborators approves them.
